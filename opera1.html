<p class="song">
    <pre>
    And now, tell me, with all the world to choose from,
    why on earth did you decide to live at the bottom of that stream?
         IOL.  To be near my son, Strephon.
         QUEEN.  Bless my heart, I didn't know you had a son.
         IOL.  He was born soon after I left my husband by your royal
    command—but he does not even know of his father's existence.
         FLETA.  How old is he?
         IOL.  Twenty-four.
         LEILA.  Twenty-four!  No one, to look at you, would think you
    had a son of twenty-four!  But that's one of the advantages of
    being immortal.  We never grow old!  Is he pretty?
         IOL.  He's extremely pretty, but he's inclined to be stout.
         ALL (disappointed).  Oh!</pre>

<h3 class="team">CHORUS for the Song</h3> 
<p class="song"><pre>
    Good morrow, good mother!
    Good mother, good morrow!
By some means or other,
    Pray banish your sorrow!
         With joy beyond telling
         My bosom is swelling,
         So join in a measure
         Expressive of pleasure,
For I'm to be married to-day—to-day—
    Yes, I'm to be married to-day!
    </pre>

<h3 class="team">CHORUS of the song</h3>  
<p class="song"><pre>
    IOL.  Then the Lord Chancellor has at last given his consent
    to your marriage with his beautiful ward, Phyllis?
         STREPH.  Not he, indeed.  To all my tearful prayers he answers
    me, "A shepherd lad is no fit helpmate for a Ward of Chancery."  I
    stood in court, and there I sang him songs of Arcadee, with
    flageolet accompaniment—in vain.  At first he seemed amused, so
    did the Bar; but quickly wearying of my song and pipe, bade me get
    out.  A servile usher then, in crumpled bands and rusty bombazine,
    led me, still singing, into Chancery Lane!  I'll go no more; I'll
    marry her to-day, and brave the upshot, be it what it may!  (Sees
    Fairies.)  But who are these?
         IOL.  Oh, Strephon!  rejoice with me, my Queen has pardoned
    me!

<h3 class="team">CHORUS of the song</h3>  
<p class="song">
<pre>
    Much good!  My dear aunt! it's the curse of my
    existence!  What's the use of being half a fairy?  My body can
    creep through a keyhole, but what's the good of that when my legs
    are left kicking behind?  I can make myself invisible down to the
    waist, but that's of no use when my legs remain exposed to view!
    My brain is a fairy brain, but from the waist downwards I'm a
    gibbering idiot.  My upper half is immortal, but my lower half
    grows older every day, and some day or other must die of old age.
    What's to become of my upper half when I've buried my lower half I
    really don't know!

    No, because your Queen, who loved her with a
    surpassing love, commuted her sentence to penal servitude for life,
    on condition that she left her husband and never communicated with
    him again!</p>

<h3 class="LEILA">LEILA.</h3> 
<p class="speech"> 
    Oh, give her back to us, great Queen, for your sake if
    not for ours!  (All kneel in supplication.)
    Oh, I should be strong, but I am weak!
    I should be marble, but I am clay!  Her punishment has been heavier
    than I intended.  I did not mean that she should live among the
    frogs—and—well, well, it shall be as you wish—it shall be as you
    wish!</p>
