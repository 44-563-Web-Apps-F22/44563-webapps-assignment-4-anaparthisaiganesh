     SONG—PRIVATE WILLIS.

        When all night long a chap remains
             On sentry-go, to chase monotony
        He exercises of his brains,
             That is, assuming that he's got any.
        Though never nurtured in the lap
             Of luxury, yet I admonish you,
        I am an intellectual chap,
             And think of things that would astonish you.
                  I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!
                  How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!
                       That every boy and every gal
                            That's born into the world alive
                       Is either a little Liberal
                            Or else a little Conservative!
                                           Fal, lal, la!
      
        When in that House M.P.'s divide,
             If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,
        They've got to leave that brain outside,
             And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.
        But then the prospect of a lot
             Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,
        All thinking for themselves, is what
             No man can face with equanimity.
                  Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!
                  That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!
                       That every boy and every gal
                            That's born into the world alive
                       Is either a little Liberal
                            Or else a little Conservative!
                                           Fal lal la!
      
        (Enter Fairies, with Celia, Leila, and Fleta.  They trip round
        stage.)
CHORUS OF FAIRIES.
      
                  Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
                  Carries every Bill he chooses.
                  To his measures all assent—
                       Showing that fairies have their uses.
                            Whigs and Tories
                            Dim their glories,
                  Giving an ear to all his stories—
                  Lords and Commons are both in the blues!
                  Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!
                       Shake in their shoes!
                       Shake in their shoes!
                  Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!
      
        (Enter Peers from Westminster Hall.)
      
CHORUS OF PEERS.
      
                  Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
                       Running a-muck of all abuses.
                  His unqualified assent
                       Somehow nobody now refuses.
                            Whigs and Tories
                            Dim their glories,
                  Giving an ear to all his stories
                  Carrying every Bill he may wish:
                  Here's a pretty kettle of fish!
                       Kettle of fish!
                       Kettle of fish!
                  Here's a pretty kettle of fish!
      
        (Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller from Westminster Hall.)
      
CELIA.  You seem annoyed.
LORD MOUNT.  Annoyed!  I should think so!  Why, this
        ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
        To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
        open to Competitive Examination!
LORD TOLL.  And he'll carry it, too!
LORD MOUNT.  Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
        Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!
